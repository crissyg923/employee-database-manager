## Description
This terminal application was created to quickly and efficiently manage an employe database.  Using simple commands, employees, departments, and roles can be created and updated.  This project gave me a basic understanding of how to use MYSQL, workbench, and the building blocks to creating databases in the future.  Check out the video walkthrough below to see this app in action.
